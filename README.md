# Setup Instructions

How to clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/DemoQuizApp-master.git

Open index.html in your browser to start the quiz.

Optionally, open the project in a text editor to modify the quiz questions or styling.

# How It Works

When the user clicks "Start Quiz", the quiz begins with a timer for each question.

The user selects an answer from the provided options. Once a selection is made, it cannot be undone.

The timer counts down from 15 seconds, and once time runs out, the user cannot select an answer.

At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed, and they have the option to replay the quiz or quit.
